## About

CODE is a student organization at Harvard Business School. Our mission is to bring technologists together at Harvard Business School. We want to keep our technical skills sharp and create accountability to learn and build while getting our MBAs. Learn more about CODE in this <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/mba/blog/post/meet-the-hbs-code-club" target="_blank">MBA Voices blog post</a>.

We've published a few pieces about our vision for building technical skills while getting an MBA in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-harbus/coding-is-the-new-busines_b_11028790.html" target="_blank">Coding is the New Business Literacy</a> (Huffington Post, 2016) and <a href="http://www.harbus.org/2017/said-harvard-mbas-dont-code/" target="_blank">Who Says Harvard MBAs Don't Code?</a> (The Harbus, 2017).
